## 📚 **Homework Links** 🔗

### 1️⃣ **[3.1 Variables & 3.4 Strings](3.1+3.4HW.html)**  
📖 *Description*: 
Variables are essential containers used to store information like numbers, text, and more complex data structures, allowing you to label and manage data in a readable way. They can be updated throughout the program. Strings, one of the most common data types, store text within quotes. They are immutable (cannot be modified), can be indexed to access specific characters, and concatenated to form new strings. Both Python and JavaScript rely heavily on these concepts, making variables and strings fundamental elements in programming.

### 2️⃣ **[3.2 Data Abstraction](3.2HW.md)**  
📖 *Description*: 
This section covers how to represent data using variables and how abstraction helps manage complexity in programming. By working with data types like strings, lists, and more, we learn to generalize and organize information effectively, making it easier to handle complex tasks and data sources in our programs.

---

### 3️⃣ **[3.3 Mathematical Expressions & 3.5 Booleans](3.3+3.5HW.md)**  
📖 *Description*: 
In this section, we explored how to use arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to perform calculations in code. Mathematical expressions help solve problems efficiently by manipulating data and variables. We also learned about Booleans, which represent true/false values. Booleans are essential for making decisions in code, such as controlling flow with conditional statements, based on logical comparisons and conditions.

---

### 4️⃣ **[3.6 Conditionals & 3.7 Nested Conditionals:](3.6+3.7HW.md)**  
📖 *Description*: 
In these sections, we learned how conditionals allow programs to make decisions by executing code only when specific conditions are true. This control flow is crucial for logic in both Python and JavaScript. Nested conditionals take this further by embedding conditionals inside other conditionals, enabling us to handle more complex decision-making processes, such as checking multiple conditions before performing an action.

---

### 5️⃣ **[3.8 Iteration](3.8HW.md)**  
📖 *Description*: 
In this section, we learned about loops, which allow us to repeat actions in a program. Iteration helps in automating repetitive tasks and processing large datasets efficiently. We explored for-loops and while-loops, focusing on how they control the flow of a program and enable more efficient coding.

## 📝 **Description of Sprint 2**  
In Sprint 2, we explored College Board's Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming, covering the foundational programming concepts essential for the AP CSP curriculum. The lessons focused on understanding the building blocks of programming, from working with variables and data abstraction to more complex topics like conditionals and iteration.

We worked through practical examples and coding exercises to reinforce each concept, preparing us for more advanced programming techniques and the Create Performance Task.

## ✏️ **My Lesson** 
- 📋 **3.10 Lists**: I taught the class about lists along with my group. Specifically on functions with arrays. For example splicing or the indexOf function. And further, the reduce() callback function and the sort() function. I also assigned the class with some homework to help further prove their understanding about these topics.
