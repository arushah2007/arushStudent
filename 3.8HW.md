3.8.1 Hack
```python

def factorial(n):
    # Handle edge cases for negative or non-integer inputs
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        return "Invalid input. Please enter a non-negative integer."
    # Base case
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the function with a number in the range of 9-13
number = 10
result = factorial(number)
custom_message = f"The factorial of {number} is {result}."
print(custom_message)
```

3.8.6 Hack
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list and print each number
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

```

Popcorn Hack
```python
def check_divisible_by_2(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{number} is divisible by 2.")
        else:
            print(f"{number} is not divisible by 2.")

# Test the function with a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
