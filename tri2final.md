# 🌐 **Profile Feature: Core CPT Requirements & Implementation**

## **📌 GitHub Issues & Burndown List**
🔗 <a href="https://github.com/XavierTho/cantella_backend/issues/27#issue-2776751759" >Profiles Github Issue</a>

---

## **🛠️ 1. Setting Up an API (Starting with Static Data)**

### **CPT Requirement: Data Abstraction & Program Implementation**
- **What I Did:**
  - Started with **static data** to simulate profile storage before integrating a database.
  - Built an **API using Flask & Flask-RESTful**, setting up basic GET/POST routes.

### **Code Example:**
```python
# Blueprint setup
profile_api = Blueprint('profile_api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')
api = Api(profile_api)

# Static Data (Initial Setup)
profiles = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Arush", "favorite_class": "Math", "grade": "B"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "John", "favorite_class": "Science", "grade": "A"}
]
```

### **How This Meets CPT Requirements:**
✅ **Data Abstraction:** Started with a simple list structure before transitioning to a full database.

✅ **Modularity:** Used Flask **Blueprints** for better organization.

✅ **Algorithmic Thinking:** Designed RESTful API endpoints for future integration.

---

## **💾 2. Setting Up a Model & Database (Ensuring Data Persistence)**

### **CPT Requirement: Data Storage & Testing**
- **What I Did:**
  - Designed a **Profile model** in SQLAlchemy.
  - Created a **relational database table** to store user data persistently, including the tester data.
  - Used **Postman** to verify CRUD operations before implementing the frontend.

### **Database Table Structure:**
📸 <img src="images/dbPOST.png" alt="database" style="width:50%;"/>

### **Code Example:**
```python
class Profile(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'profiles'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    _name = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)  # User's name
    _classes = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=False)  # JSON column to store classes
    _favorite_class = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)  # Favorite class
    _grade = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=False)  # Grade
```

### **Postman Testing:**
📌 **Tested API endpoints for:**
- **GET /api/profiles** → Fetch all profiles.
- **POST /api/profiles** → Add new profiles.
- **PUT /api/profiles** → Update an existing profile.
- **DELETE /api/profiles** → Remove profiles.

### **How This Meets CPT Requirements:**
✅ **Data Storage:** Ensured user data is stored persistently in a database.

✅ **Testing & Debugging:** Used Postman to verify API functionality.

✅ **Program Implementation:** Designed models using SQLAlchemy ORM.

---

## **🌍 3. Full Stack Integration (Connecting API to Frontend)**

### **CPT Requirement: Data Representation & User Interaction**
- **What I Did:**
  - Created a **frontend UI** that dynamically interacts with the backend.
  - Used **JavaScript Fetch API** to display profiles in real-time.
  - Ensured users could **create, read, update, and delete profiles** seamlessly.
  - Learned the implementation of fullstack through **tech talks**


### **Code Example:**
```javascript
  try {
      const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}`, {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
      credentials: 'include'
     });
```


### **How This Meets CPT Requirements:**
✅ **User Interaction:** Created a seamless UI for profile management.

✅ **Data Representation:** Dynamically displayed profile data from API calls.

✅ **Integration:** Connected **backend API with frontend logic**.

## **📚 4. Flashcards Page - Streamlined User Experience**
🎯 **Objective:** Enhance functionality and ease of use.
🛠 **Implementation:**
- Used **progressive disclosure** to reveal UI elements only when needed.
- Designed a clean interface where **"Add New Flashcard"** appears only after selecting a deck.
- Utilized **conditional rendering** in JavaScript.



📊 **Flashcards Flowchart:** *(inspriation from the student panel)*

## **🎨 5. General Aesthetics & Website Unity**
🎯 **Objective:** Maintain a professional and cohesive UI.
🎨 **Implementation:**
- Used **grey background with orange accents** throughout different pages on the site for consistency.
- Standardized UI elements across all pages.
- Added **favicons (pencil & trashcan icons) and delete sound effect** for usability.

# 📝 **Personal Reflection: Strengths & Weaknesses**

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|--------------|---------------|
| *Communication/Collaboration:* I was able to communicate very well with my group, setting up meetings, calls, and more. We were able to stay on the same page a lot which helped streamline this project. Additionally, we shared ideas very beneficially and were able to collaborate clearly, avoiding conflicts. | I think I can be more active in class and ask more questions to get to my answers faster. I will definetely work in this next tri. |
| *Troubleshooting:* I have been able to quickly understand challenges and issues that arose in our project which was very beneficial to troubleshoot for the whole group to be more productive. | At times, I have relied on last minute efforts to finish my work which could be done better with better time management. |
| *Adaptability:* I have been able to adapt during this project which has proven beneficial to my team and my personal work. It has been key to making sure I can work around the many issues that arise while working on code. It is something that I have grown in during the tri, and aqcquired while working on more and more things. | Sometimes I may focus on certain problems/goals within the project too much, which makes me spend too much time on things that may be more unnecessary. I can improve this my creating lists to clearly see what is the most important and first priority of work. These lists would improve efficiency greatly. |


<h3> <b>Solutions:</b> Next trimester I will focus on a few main things. Asking more questions, participating more in class, and creating more burndown lists and issues to be more clear on my work. 
</h3>

            📝 <b>Blog Readability:</b> "The blog's format makes it difficult to pick out individual sections that work to fulfill each requirement."

            ⚠️ <b>Usability Issue:</b> When adding a new profile, the form appears at the bottom of the page, requiring users to scroll down—this is inconvenient.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #17a2b8;">📌 How This Helped Me Prepare</h3>
    <p>
        Brandon's feedback allowed me to pinpoint areas that need improvement before the final review. Based on his suggestions, I will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔹 Improve the <b>blog's organization</b> to make requirements clearer.</li>
        <li>🔹 Add <b>more visuals</b> to break up text-heavy sections.</li>
        <li>🔹 Fix the <b>profile creation UI issue</b> so users immediately see when a new profile is added.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>By exchanging feedback and practicing presentations, we both strengthened our final exam preparation.</b> This collaboration gave us a fresh perspective on our projects and helped refine our work.</p>
