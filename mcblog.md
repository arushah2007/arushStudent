# My AP CSP Practice Test Review

## What I Learned From the Quiz
Taking this quiz really helped me figure out what I’m good at and what I need to work on. I did well in topics like iteration and developing procedures, but I struggled with areas like data compression and nested conditionals. It was a great way to see what I know and what I need to focus on to improve.

---

## What Type of Questions I Struggled With
After looking at the results, here are the areas I found the hardest:

1. **Data Compression**
   - **Performance**: 0% (2 questions)
   - I didn’t get any answers correct in this section, which shows I need to spend more time understanding how data compression works. This includes figuring out how to make files smaller while keeping important information. 

2. **Lists**
   - **Performance**: 25% (4 questions)
   - I only got 1 out of 4 questions right here. Lists are super important in programming, so I definitely need more practice with creating, modifying, and working with them.

3. **Program Design and Development**
   - **Performance**: 25% (4 questions)
   - This section was tough because it’s about planning and building programs. I think I need to get better at organizing my ideas before I start coding.

4. **Random Values**
   - **Performance**: 50% (2 questions)
   - I got half the questions right here. Random values are used a lot in things like simulations, so I want to make sure I really understand how they work.

5. **Conditionals**
   - **Performance**: 50% (2 questions)
   - Writing "if" and "else" statements wasn’t too bad, but when things got more complicated, I had a harder time. I need to practice writing more complex conditional logic.

## How I Can Improve
Here are some steps I’m planning to take to get better:

- **Data Compression**: I’m going to read more about how lossless and lossy compression work and look at examples of how to shrink file sizes without losing important details. 
- **Lists**: I’ll practice using lists in Python by creating and modifying them. I want to get better at things like adding items, removing items, and looping through them.
- **Program Design and Development**: I think practicing with pseudocode and flowcharts will help me plan programs better before I start coding.
- **Random Values**: I’m going to work on generating random numbers in Python and learn how they’re used in simulations and games.
- **Conditionals**: I’ll practice writing “if” and “else” statements with more layers and complexity so I feel more confident.

**Corrections Of My Hardest Questions**

- Q26: I put D but the answer is A because this code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.
- Q35: I put C but the answer is D because Creative Commons licenses can be used by creators of digital music to specify how the samples can be used by others. A no-rights-reserved license allows others to freely make use of the samples.
- Q42: I put B but the answer is D because With 32-bit addressing, IPv4 has 2^32 possible addresses. With 128-bit addressing, IPv6 has 2^128 possible addresses. Since 2^32 times 2^96 equals 2^128, IPv6 has 2^196 as many possible addresses as IPv4.
- Q53: I put D but the answer is A because it describes machine learning as the process of a computer analyzing data in order to make predictions and decisions based on trends in the data.
- Q59: I put D but the answer is B becasue using lossy compression will provide only an approximation of the original video data. The full-quality original versions of the videos will be lost if lossy compression is used.
- Q65: I left this blank but the answers were B and D because  If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases.
