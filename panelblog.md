# How I Can Improve My AP CSP Projects

After listening to the student panel, I’ve realized that better **planning** and **communication** can significantly improve the quality of my projects. Here’s how I plan to apply their advice:

## 1. Planning with Diagrams
To organize my ideas better, I’ll use tools like **Draw.io** to create **flowcharts**, **use-case diagrams**, and **UML diagrams**. These diagrams will help me visualize the structure of my app, how users navigate it, and how different components interact. For example:
- **Flowcharts**: Map out the step-by-step logic of features. I can use this in many of our sprint projects. like our current social media site to showcase the step-by-step features I build.
- **Use-case diagrams**: Show how users interact with the app. I can also use this in the current social media site to give a user-story on how it work work, displaying functionality.
- **UML diagrams**: Illustrate the relationships between different parts of the system, such as classes and their methods. I can use this for more in depth breakdowns of backend functions.

Having these diagrams ready will make it easier for my team to understand the project and for me to plan my coding process effectively.

## 2. Documenting My Work
Good **documentation** is essential. In future sprints, I’ll:
- Add meaningful comments to my code for further explanation
- Write brief overviews of major features.
- Create user stories that outline how to use my feature.

This will not only make my work easier to understand for others but will also build professional habits for future internships.

## 3. Using GitHub for Organization
I’ll use **GitHub** to stay organized and collaborate effectively. Some steps I’ll take include:
- Writing clear commit messages.
- Using branches for separate features.
- Writing more issues and using the Kanban board more.

This will help my projects look professional and demonstrate strong collaboration skills.
